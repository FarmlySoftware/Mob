                            <p> Dealing with Farmly for our businesses new data/database server was a pleasure. They helped us choose the correct server for our needs and was still reasonable price. With that said they don't just sell you a sever and leave you to your own devices, they will install it and make sure it is all running smoothly before they sign off on it. We also took out there monthly server maintenance and security package and compared to other companies that I got quotes from this was the most inclusive with anti-virus and network security software along with server maintenance and upkeep while being the best price. It was an pleasure and still is dealing with Farmly software and highly recommended.</p>
